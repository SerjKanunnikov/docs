# Getting started with {{ mch-short-name }}

To get started with the service:

- [Create a DB cluster](#cluster-create).
- [Connect to the DB](#connect).


## Before you start {#before-you-begin}

1. Go to the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}). Then log in to Yandex.Cloud or sign up if you don't have an account.

1. If you don't have a folder yet, create one:

    {% include [create-folder](../_includes/create-folder.md) %}

You can connect to DB clusters from both inside and outside of the Cloud:

1. To connect to a DB cluster from inside the Cloud, create a VM in the same network as the DB cluster (based on [Linux](../compute/quickstart/quick-create-linux.md) or [Windows](../compute/quickstart/quick-create-windows.md))
1. To connect to a cluster from the internet, request public access to the hosts when creating the cluster.


## Create a cluster {#cluster-create}

1. In the management console, select the folder where you want to create a DB cluster.
1. Select **{{ mch-name }}**.
1. Click **Create cluster**.
1. Set the cluster parameters and click **Create cluster**. This process is described in detail in [{#T}](operations/cluster-create.md).
1. When the cluster is ready to operate, its status on the {{ mch-short-name }} dashboard changes to **Running** and its state to **Alive**. This may take some time.

## Connect to the DB {#connect}

1. To connect to the DB server, get an SSL certificate:

    
    1. Create a folder:

        ```bash
        $ mkdir ~/.clickhouse
        ```

    1. Get a certificate:

        ```bash
        $ wget "https://storage.yandexcloud.net/cloud-certs/CA.pem" -O ~/.clickhouse/root.crt
        ```

    1. Configure permissions to the certificate:

        ```bash
        $ chmod 0600 ~/.clickhouse/root.crt
        ```

   

1. Use the ClickHouse CLI to connect:
    1. Specify the path to the SSL certificate in the [configuration file](https://clickhouse.yandex/docs/en/interfaces/cli/#interfaces_cli_configuration) in the `<caConfig>` element:

    ```xml
    <config>
      <openSSL>
        <client>
          <loadDefaultCAFile>true</loadDefaultCAFile>
          <caConfig>~/.clickhouse/root.crt</caConfig>
          <cacheSessions>true</cacheSessions>
          <disableProtocols>sslv2,sslv3</disableProtocols>
          <preferServerCiphers>true</preferServerCiphers>
          <invalidCertificateHandler>
            <name>RejectCertificateHandler</name>
          </invalidCertificateHandler>
        </client>
      </openSSL>
    </config>
    ```
    1. Run the ClickHouse CLI with the following parameters:

    ```bash
    clickhouse-client --host <host FQDN> \
                      -s \
                      --user <DB user name> \
                      --password <DB user password> \
                      -q "<DB query>" \
                      --port 9440 
    ```
