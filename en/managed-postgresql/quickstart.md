# Getting started with {{ mpg-short-name }}

To get started with the service:

- [Create a DB cluster](#cluster-create).
- [Connect to the DB](#connect).


## Before you start {#before-you-begin}

1. Go to the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}). Then log in to Yandex.Cloud or sign up if you don't have an account.

1. If you don't have a folder yet, create one:

    {% include [create-folder](../_includes/create-folder.md) %}

You can connect to DB clusters from both inside and outside of the Cloud:

1. To connect to a DB cluster from inside Yandex.Cloud, create a VM in the same network as the DB cluster (with [Linux](../compute/quickstart/quick-create-linux.md) or [Windows](../compute/quickstart/quick-create-windows.md)).
1. To connect to a cluster from the internet, request public access to the hosts when creating the cluster.


## Create a cluster {#cluster-create}

1. In the management console, select the folder where you want to create a DB cluster.
1. Select **{{ mpg-name }}**.
1. Click **Create cluster**.
1. Set the cluster parameters and click **Create cluster**. This process is described in detail in [{#T}](operations/cluster-create.md).
1. When the cluster is ready, its status on the {{ mpg-short-name }} dashboard changes to **Running** and its state to **Alive**. This may take some time.

## Connect to the DB {#connect}

1. To connect to the DB server, get an SSL certificate:

    
    1. Create a folder:

        ```bash
        $ mkdir ~/.postgresql
        ```

    1. Get a certificate:

        ```bash
        $ wget "https://storage.yandexcloud.net/cloud-certs/CA.pem" -O ~/.postgresql/root.crt
        ```

    1. Configure permissions to the certificate:

        ```bash
        $ chmod 0600 ~/.postgresql/root.crt
        ```

   

1. Use the `psql` command to connect:

    ```bash
    $ psql "host=<host address> \
          port=6432 \
          sslmode=verify-full \
          dbname=<DB name> \
          user=<DB user name>"
    ```
